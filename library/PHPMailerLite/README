PHPMailer-Lite
Full Featured Email Transfer Class for PHP
==========================================

Version 5.1 (October xx, 2009)

Notable differences between PHPMailer and PHPMailer Lite:
  - PHPMailer Lite does not include support for SMTP
  - PHPMailer Lite supports Sendmail (or Qmail) by default
  - PHPMailer Lite requires one single file (if you need language support,
    use the language files from PHPMailer - the only difference in language
    files is PHPMailer Lite does not include any SMTP messages)

We also have created a new test script (see /test) that you can use
right out of the box. Copy the /test folder directly to your server (in
the same structure ... with class.phpmailer-lite.php in the folder above it.
Then launch the test script with:
http://www.yourdomain.com/phpmailer/test/index.php
from this one script, you can test your server settings for mail(), or sendmail
(or qmail). This will email you a sample email (using contents.html for
the email body) and two attachments. One of the attachments is used as an inline
image to demonstrate how PHPMailer will automatically detect if attachments are
the same source as inline graphics and only include one version. Once you click
the Submit button, the results will be displayed including send status. We will
also display a version of the script that you can cut and paste to include in
your projects. Enjoy!

Enjoy!

This software is licenced under the LGPL.  Please read LICENSE for information on the
software availability and distribution.

Class Features:
- Send emails with multiple TOs, CCs, BCCs and REPLY-TOs
- Multipart/alternative emails for mail clients that do not read HTML email
- Support for 8bit, base64, binary, and quoted-printable encoding
- Uses the same methods as the very popular AspEmail active server (COM) component
- Word wrap, and more!

Why you might need it:

Many PHP developers utilize email in their code.  The only PHP function
that supports this is the mail() function.  However, it does not expose
any of the popular features that many email clients use nowadays like
HTML-based emails and attachments. There are two proprietary
development tools out there that have all the functionality built into
easy to use classes: AspEmail(tm) and AspMail.  Both of these
programs are COM components only available on Windows.  They are also a
little pricey for smaller projects.

Since I do Linux development Iï¿½ve missed these tools for my PHP coding.
So I built a version myself that implements the same methods (object
calls) that the Windows-based components do. It is open source and the
LGPL license allows you to place the class in your proprietary PHP
projects.

Installation:

Copy class.phpmailer-lite.php into your php.ini include_path. 

That's it.  You should now be ready to use PHPMailer!

A Simple Example:

<?php
require("class.phpmailer-lite.php");

$mail = new PHPMailerLite();

$mail->SetFrom('you@yourdomain.com', 'Your Name');

$mail->AddAddress("josh@example.net", "Josh Adams");
$mail->AddAddress("ellen@example.com");                  // name is optional

$mail->WordWrap = 50;                                 // set word wrap to 50 characters
$mail->AddAttachment("/var/tmp/file.tar.gz");         // add attachments
$mail->AddAttachment("/tmp/image.jpg", "new.jpg");    // optional name
$mail->IsHTML(true);                                  // set email format to HTML

$mail->Subject = "Here is the subject";
$mail->Body    = "This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>";
$mail->AltBody = "This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients";

if(!$mail->Send())
{
   echo "Message could not be sent. <p>";
   echo "Mailer Error: " . $mail->ErrorInfo;
   exit;
}

echo "Message has been sent";
?>
